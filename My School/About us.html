        <h2>ABOUT US : </h2>
        <div class="about">
        <p>We welcome you to Euro International School, Sikar, a name which is synonymous with excellence in education. The importance of education in the life of an individual cannot be overstated. It shapes individuals 
        in their formative years and imbues them with values that would govern all their choices in life. </p><br>
        <p>For me, Education does not just mean providing answers. It means equipping the pupil with the means to find the answers for himself & within himself. Education is guidance 
        into knowing the self, in realizing choices, in developing awareness about one’s identity, and the real nature of life. Education empowers students to discover themselves – who they are as people. </p><br>
        <p>
        Over the years, I have witnessed in our students an unparalleled knowledge base, a vibrant dynamism, an acute 
        consciousness about the world around them, a focused ambition and a sustained commitment. I am also fortunate to have an experienced
        and committed team, which has brought the school to its present stature. I, along with my team of salient workers & dedicated faculty,intend to build on this strong foundation and raise the standards in
        all spheres, to the zenith. My aim is not only to be an able administrator but also to be a friend, philosopher and guide to
        students one whom they can count on and trust at all times. A great scholar has rightly said- “Victories are gained, peace is preserved, progress is achieved, civilization 
        is built up and history is made not on the battlefield, not in the council of chambers not even in factories, but in educational institutions which are the seedbeds of culture, where children, in whose hands alter the destinies of future, are trained.
